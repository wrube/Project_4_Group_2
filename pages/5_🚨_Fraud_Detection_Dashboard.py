    st.header("Which is More Acceptable?")
    st.markdown("""
    **In credit card fraud detection, false positives are generally more acceptable than false negatives for the following reasons:**
    1. Financial Impact: The direct financial loss from false negatives (missed fraud) is typically more significant than the operational costs of handling false positives.
    2. Customer Trust: Protecting customers from fraud (even at the cost of some inconvenience) helps maintain trust and confidence in the credit card company.
    3. Security: Proactively catching potential fraud helps in maintaining the overall security of the system and deterring fraudsters.
    
    **Balancing Both:** While minimizing false negatives is crucial, an effective fraud detection system aims to strike a balance where both false positives and false negatives are kept at acceptable levels. This balance is typically achieved by optimizing the model for metrics like the F1-score, which considers both precision (minimizing false positives) and recall (minimizing false negatives).
    """)

    st.header("Understanding Probability in the System")
    st.markdown("""
    When a machine learning model predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent or not, it often outputs a probability score. This score represents the likelihood that the transaction belongs to a particular class (fraudulent or legitimate).

    **How Probabilities are Used:**
    1. Threshold-Based Classification:
        - The model outputs a probability between 0 and 1.
        - A threshold is set (commonly 0.5). If the probability is above the threshold, the transaction is classified as fraudulent; otherwise, it is classified as legitimate.
    2. Confidence in Predictions:
        - The probability score indicates the model's confidence in its prediction.
        - For example, a probability of 0.9 for a transaction being fraudulent means the model is 90% confident in its prediction.
    3. Decision Making:
        - Probabilities can be used to prioritize investigations. Higher probability transactions can be reviewed first.
        - Adjusting the threshold can balance between false positives and false negatives based on business needs.
    
    **Practical Implications:**
    1. High Probability of Fraud (e.g., >0.8):
        - The system is highly confident that the transaction is fraudulent.
        - Immediate action can be taken, such as blocking the transaction or alerting the cardholder.
    2. Low Probability of Fraud (e.g., <0.2):
        - The system is highly confident that the transaction is legitimate.
        - The transaction can be processed without additional checks.
    3. Intermediate Probability (e.g., 0.4 to 0.6):
        - There is uncertainty in the prediction.
        - These transactions might be flagged for further review by fraud analysts.
    
    **Example Explanation:**
    Consider a transaction where the model outputs a probability of 0.85 for being fraudulent:
    - System Action: The system will likely classify this transaction as fraudulent (assuming a threshold of 0.5) and may trigger an alert or block the transaction.
    - Confidence Level: The model is 85% confident in this prediction. This high probability suggests a strong likelihood of fraud.
    """)

    st.header("Feature Importance")
    st.markdown("""
    **Definition:** Feature importance refers to techniques that assign a score to input features based on how useful they are at predicting a target variable.

    **In terms of credit card fraud:** Feature importance helps in identifying which features (such as transaction amount, location, time, etc.) have the most influence on predicting whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.

    **How it Works:**
    - **Tree-based Models:** For models like Random Forest or XGBoost, feature importance can be derived from the model itself as these models can compute the importance of each feature.
    - **Permutation Importance:** This technique involves shuffling the values of each feature and measuring how much the shuffling decreases the model's performance. Features that are important will see a significant decrease in performance when their values are shuffled.

    **Why it Matters:**
    - **Model Interpretation:** Understanding which features are important helps in interpreting the model's decisions, making it easier to trust and verify the model's predictions.
    - **Feature Selection:** By identifying the most important features, you can potentially reduce the number of features in the dataset, leading to simpler and more efficient models.
    - **Improving Model Performance:** Focusing on the most important features can help in improving the model's performance.

    **Example Explanation:**
    If the model indicates that the 'transaction amount' is the most important feature, it means that the transaction amount plays a significant role in determining whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. This insight can be valuable for developing targeted fraud detection strategies.
